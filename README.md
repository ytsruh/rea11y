# Re-a11y

The accessibility testing and project management application.

## Notes

- Installing Pa11y & Puppeteer to Azure Functions throws an error if the build is done locally, must be run remote. A deploy NPM script has been added as well as .vscode/settings.json being updated " azureFunctions.scmDoBuildDuringDeployment: true " variable.
