        Designers & developers must keep accessibility in mind when creating their sites & products.
        Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We
        traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites
        accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network
        connections.

      <h4 class="text-2xl dark:text-primary font-bold mb-3 uppercase">Access through technology</h4>
      <p class="mb-8">
        Accessibility can be viewed as the "ability to access" and benefit from some system or entity. The
        concept focuses on enabling access for people with disabilities, or enabling access through the use of
        assistive technology; however, research and development in accessibility brings benefits to everyone.

      <p class="mb-8">
        15% of the worldâ€™s population has some sort of disability. Brands with inaccessible websites are
        failing to accommodate a growing portion of the population. The number of people living with
        disabilities is expected to grow considerably over the coming decades which will only give rise to
        more guidelines, legislation, and enforcement.
